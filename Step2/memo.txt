	The pom.xml is the recipe that will be used to build your project
	Spring Boot provides a number of “Starter POMs” that make easy to add jars to your classpath
	mvn dependency:tree command prints a tree representation of your project dependencies
	
	add the spring-boot-starter-web
	including the Tomcat web server and Spring Boot itself.
